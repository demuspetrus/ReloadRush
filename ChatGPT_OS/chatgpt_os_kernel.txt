CHATGPT OS KERNEL (v0.6)
-----------------------------
Purpose: Manage Memory Banks (create, list, switch, checkpoint).

[Registry]
active = None
banks = []          # e.g., [{"name":"Project","purpose":"tasks+notes"}]
checkpoints = {}    # per-bank labeled snapshots

Commands
--------
NEWBANK <name> : <purpose>
  Create and register a new bank.
  Example: NEWBANK Project : Track tasks and notes

LIST
  Show all registered banks.

INFO <name>
  Show purpose and whether it is active.

SWITCH <name>
  Set the active bank.

CHECKPOINT "<label>"
  Save a checkpoint of the active bank.
  (Kernel stores a copy of the bank's snapshot under this label.)

REVERT "<label>"
  Restore the active bank to that checkpoint.

SNAPSHOT
  Show Kernel registry and active bank.

HELP
  Show these commands.


Behavior
--------
- Kernel keeps the registry and mediates switching.
- The **bank file** you load (e.g., empty_bank_starter.txt, General, Sudoku, etc.)
  defines the **in-bank commands** (SET, APPEND, MOVE, etc.).
- Kernel commands DO NOT alter the bankâ€™s internal rules; they manage selection and history.

Quick start
-----------
1) Say: Use ChatGPT OS.
2) NEWBANK Project : Track tasks and notes
3) SWITCH Project
4) Upload a bank starter (e.g., empty_bank_starter.txt) and use its commands.
5) CHECKPOINT "v1"
6) Continue working; REVERT "v1" if needed.
