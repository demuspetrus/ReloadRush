MEMORY BANK FACTORY (Meta Bank Starter Kit)
---------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
This is a *factory* for creating and managing other Memory Banks. 
It holds a registry of banks, their names, and their purposes. 
If asked "Can you make a Memory Bank for X?", the Factory either reuses 
an existing template or generates a new one, then adds it to the registry.


Snapshot format
---------------

- Chess Memory Bank → "Tracks a chessboard snapshot + moves"
- Sudoku Memory Bank → "Tracks a Sudoku grid + legality rules"
- General Memory Bank → "Tracks projects, notes, tasks, budgets"


Commands
--------
NEW <name> : <purpose>
  Create a new memory bank definition.
  Example: NEW Recipe Memory Bank : Track cooking recipes step by step.

LIST
  Show all existing memory banks and their purposes.

INFO <name>
  Show details of one memory bank (rules, format, usage).
