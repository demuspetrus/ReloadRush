GENERAL MEMORY BANK STARTER KIT (for fresh chat sessions)
---------------------------------------------------------

Goal
----
Keep one shared state with simple, logged updates. Works for drafts, tasks,
research notes, budgets, study logs, and more. Paste this file into a new chat
and say: "Use this Memory Bank."


Snapshot format
---------------
Blocks define the current state. Keep it plain text.

[Project]
title = Example Project
owner = You
status = planning

[Tasks]
todo = ["set scope", "collect sources"]
doing = []
done = []

[Notes]
draft = <<
This is the working draft.
Use short lines. Keep edits small.
>>


Chat commands (you type these)
------------------------------
SNAPSHOT

SET <Block.key> = <value>
  Example: SET Project.status = in-progress

APPEND <Block.key> += <item>

MOVE <from_list> -> <to_list> : "<item>"
  Example: MOVE Tasks.todo -> Tasks.doing : "collect sources"

Examples you can try
--------------------
1) Tasks flow
   APPEND Tasks.todo += "prepare figures"
   MOVE Tasks.todo -> Tasks.doing : "set scope"
   MOVE Tasks.doing -> Tasks.done  : "set scope"

2) Draft edit
   REPLACE Notes.draft : "working" -> "living"
   EDIT Notes.draft = <<
   Intro:
   - Why this matters
   - What we will do
   >>

3) Budget
   SET Budget.month = "2025-09"
   SET Budget.items = [{"name":"books","eur":18},{"name":"coffee","eur":6}]

4) Study log
   SET Study.topic = "Unity basics"
   APPEND Study.sessions += {"date":"2025-09-01","mins":40,"note":"input system"}


Rules
-----
- I keep the full state and a change log.
- I validate commands and confirm each change.
- Ask SNAPSHOT any time.
- Keep updates small and clear.
- If you are unsure, say HELP.


Quick start
-----------
1) Say: "Use this Memory Bank."
2) Then try:
   SET Project.status = in-progress
   APPEND Tasks.todo += "first milestone"
