MEMORY BANK FACTORY (Meta Bank Starter Kit)
---------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
This is a *factory* for creating and managing other Memory Banks. 
It holds a registry of banks, their names, and their purposes. 
If asked "Can you make a Memory Bank for X?", the Factory either reuses 
an existing template or generates a new one, then adds it to the registry.
