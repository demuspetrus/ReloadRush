# UtilMemoryBanks

This folder contains general-purpose Memory Banks that are not tied to a specific game.

**Included here:**
- **General Memory Bank Starter** – an all-purpose memory bank for projects, tasks, drafts, or notes.  
- **Memory Bank Factory** – a meta-bank that manages and generates other banks on demand.  

The ChessMemoryBank is kept separate in the root, since it is linked to my article.
