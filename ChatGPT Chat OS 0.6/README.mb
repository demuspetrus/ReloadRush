# ChatGPT Chat OS 0.6

ChatGPT Chat OS 0.6 is a minimal operating layer built from **Memory Banks**.  
It lets you keep structured state inside a chat by combining two simple rules:  
- Start from a **snapshot**  
- Apply updates with **small, explicit commands**  

This avoids forgetting and makes it possible to manage projects, notes, or even games in a consistent way.

---

## Components

- **OS Kernel** (`chatgpt_os_kernel.txt`)  
  Manages banks: create, list, switch, checkpoint, revert.  

- **Empty Bank Starter** (`empty_bank_starter.txt`)  
  A minimal template you can adapt to anything.  

- **(Optional Banks)**  
  You can add domain-specific banks (General, Factory, Chess, Sudoku, etc.).

## Quick Start

1. Open a new ChatGPT session.  
2. Upload `chatgpt_os_kernel.txt`.  
3. Say: `Use ChatGPT OS`.  
4. Create a bank:  

NEWBANK Project : Track tasks and notes

5. Switch to it:  

SWITCH Project

6. Upload `empty_bank_starter.txt` (or another bank file).  
7. Update state with the bank’s commands.  
8. Ask `SNAPSHOT` any time to see the state.  
9. Use `CHECKPOINT "label"` and `REVERT "label"` to save and restore versions.

## OS-Level Commands

- `NEWBANK <name> : <purpose>` – create and register a new bank  
- `LIST` – list all banks  
- `INFO <name>` – show details of a bank  
- `SWITCH <name>` – set the active bank  
- `CHECKPOINT "<label>"` – save a snapshot of the active bank  
- `REVERT "<label>"` – restore the active bank to a checkpoint  
- `SNAPSHOT` – show registry and active bank  
- `HELP` – show available commands

## Why ChatGPT OS?

This is not a computer OS.  
It is a **conversation OS** – a way to keep memory stable in a chat environment.  

By combining the Kernel with different banks, you can:  
- Manage writing, projects, and research  
- Track learning and study sessions  
- Play structured games like chess or sudoku  
- Invent and register new banks for any domain

## Version

This is version **0.6**, early and experimental.  
It shows the foundation of a simple but powerful idea: *snapshot + updates*.
